jQuery EasyDate Plugin
----

EasyDate is a jQuery plugin to format dates into a human-readable form and continuously update them to stay accurate while the user remains on the page. The plugin will parse a RFC 1123 valid timestamp from a DOM element's title attribute or innerHTML property and format it into a human-readable form (e.g., "2 weeks ago").

This is a fork of the original EasyDate plugin located here http://easydate.parshap.com/ which did not support jQuery 1.6 and possibly others above 1.4.2. Support was added with a hack to use actual element ID attribute to ensure uniqueness.


TODO
----

- Add some sample/demo pages showing simple use cases.

- Update so that when a live .easydate element does not have an ID, generate a random/unique ID to use and assign. The current workaround requires each live .easydate to have a unique id attribute in order to ensure updates occur only once. This was the breaking point from the originally supported jQuery 1.4.2.
